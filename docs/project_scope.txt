📌 Project Scope
Zawify is a gift registry and wishlist platform that enables users to:
* Create and customize personal gift lists for birthdays, weddings, graduations, and other milestones.

* Share registries with friends and family through links or social platforms.

* Explore curated gift ideas for inspiration.

Scope Boundaries:
   * Focus on building a minimal viable product (MVP) first (wishlist creation + sharing).

   * Start with a web-based solution, then expand to mobile in later phases.

   * Initial monetization through ads and crowdfunding, with scope to expand into partnerships with e-commerce platforms.
