❗ Problem Statement
Gift-giving today often results in mismatched, duplicated, or unwanted items—causing waste and reducing the joy of giving. Existing platforms like Giftster and Zola mainly serve niche markets such as weddings or family circles, but they fall short for everyday occasions, diverse cultural traditions, and social integrations. There is a gap for a versatile, user-friendly, and inclusive gifting platform that adapts to modern lifestyles.
