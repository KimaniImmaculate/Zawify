📌 Project Scope
Zawify is a gift registry and wishlist platform that enables users to:
* Create and customize personal gift lists for birthdays, weddings, graduations, and other milestones.

* Share registries with friends and family through links or social platforms.

* Explore curated gift ideas for inspiration.

Scope Boundaries:
   * Focus on building a minimal viable product (MVP) first (wishlist creation + sharing).

   * Start with a web-based solution, then expand to mobile in later phases.

   * Initial monetization through ads and crowdfunding, with scope to expand into partnerships with e-commerce platforms.




🌍 SDG Alignment
      * SDG 9 (Industry, Innovation & Infrastructure): Building an innovative digital platform that supports social gifting.

      * SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption & Production): Encouraging thoughtful, sustainable gift-giving by reducing waste from unwanted gifts.

      * SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals): Enabling collaboration with e-commerce platforms, NGOs, and communities to expand reach.


❗ Problem Statement
Gift-giving today often results in mismatched, duplicated, or unwanted items—causing waste and reducing the joy of giving. Existing platforms like Giftster and Zola mainly serve niche markets such as weddings or family circles, but they fall short for everyday occasions, diverse cultural traditions, and social integrations. There is a gap for a versatile, user-friendly, and inclusive gifting platform that adapts to modern lifestyles.
